It's strongly recommended to install pymbook using your OS's package
system rather than using setup.py yourself.  You can find instructions
for many distributions at:

  http://code.google.com/p/pymbook/

If you don't have this option, please make sure you satisfy pymbook's
dependencies yourself:

 * Python 2.5+, 2.6 recommended:
     Debian/Ubuntu: python
     FreeBSD: lang/python26

If you don't care about native language support or icons, Terminator
should run just fine directly from this directory, just:

    ./pymbook

And go from there.

To install properly, run:

    ./setup.py install --record=install-files.txt

See --help for an overview of the available options; e.g. --prefix to
install to a custom base directory, and --without-gettext to avoid
installing natural language support files.

setup.py supports basic uninstallation provided --record was used for
installation as above:

    ./setup.py uninstall --manifest=install-files.txt

Note that uninstall will avoid removing most empty directories so it
won't harm e.g. locale or icon directories which only contain Terminator
data.  It also won't rebuild the icon cache, so you may wish to:

     gtk-update-icon-cache -q -f ${PREFIX}/share/icons/hicolor

Where ${PREFIX} is the base install directory; e.g. /usr/local.
